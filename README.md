# YouTube Digest

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Turn every YouTube video into a resource for deep learning. YouTube Digest brings transcripts, bilingual translation, AI overviews, explanations, and timestamped notes into one Chrome side panel, so you can study ideas and language without losing your place.

- Turn captions into a readable, searchable learning resource.
- Learn languages with the original transcript, a Simplified Chinese translation, or an aligned bilingual view.
- Build understanding with an AI overview, chapters, key quotes, and selected-text explanations.
- Navigate long videos by clicking timestamps in the transcript, overview, or notes.
- Save polished timestamped notes for later study.
- Keep control of your data with your own API keys, local Chrome storage, and no analytics or telemetry.

YouTube Digest is a bring-your-own-key project installed locally from GitHub. It is not available through the Chrome Web Store, does not include API credits, and does not run a developer-operated server.

## New in v1.4.0

- Manage multiple AI Provider cards in **Settings**, each with its own name, API key, HTTPS endpoint, and model.
- Add built-in profiles for DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, MiniMax, and Xiaomi MiMo, or add a custom OpenAI-compatible service.
- Test a Provider before using it, switch the active Provider at any time, and request access only to the selected API origin.
- Upgrade existing v1.3 DeepSeek settings automatically without exposing or copying the saved key.

Also included from v1.3.0:

- Choose **Original**, **中文**, or **双语** independently in **Transcript**, **Overview**, and **Notes**, using the same familiar control on each page.
- Remember each choice by video ID and page. A new video's three pages all start in **Original**, so translation never begins unexpectedly.
- Translate only the active page, show results progressively in small batches, and reuse the page's cached translations when you return.
- Keep the original content available if a translation fails, with a local retry for only the affected content instead of blocking the whole page.
- Use a Simplified Chinese interface throughout, while retaining the agreed labels—YouTube Digest, Settings, Transcript, Overview, Notes, Original, and Copy—and established brand or technical names.

## Install with your coding agent

You do not need to understand the code or use the command line. Send this message to your coding agent:

> Download or clone this project into a permanent folder I choose, tell me its exact full path, and use that same folder for Chrome's Load unpacked step. If I need a suggestion during this first installation, offer `~/Documents/youtube-digest` on macOS or Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\youtube-digest` on Windows, but do not assume either path. Walk me through installation and setup in simple terms. https://github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest

Your agent should:

1. Ask where you want to keep the project, download or clone it there, and tell you the exact full path. If you want a suggestion, it can offer `~/Documents/youtube-digest` on macOS or Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\youtube-digest` on Windows.
2. Open the official Supadata page and the AI Provider page you choose, then help you create your own accounts.
3. Walk you through selecting the exact project folder you chose in Chrome with **Load unpacked**.
4. Show you where to enter your API keys in the extension's **Settings** page.
5. Open a YouTube video with captions and confirm the transcript and translation work.

Keep this folder in the same place after installation. If you move or delete it, Chrome's unpacked extension stops working until you load the extension again from its new permanent folder.

Never paste an API key into an AI chat, source file, screenshot, or public message. Enter keys yourself, directly in the YouTube Digest Settings page. Your coding agent can point to the correct field without seeing the key.

## Install manually

If you prefer to do it yourself:

1. Open [github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/youtube-digest).
2. Choose **Code**, then **Download ZIP**.
3. Choose a permanent folder and unzip the project there. Optional suggestions are `~/Documents/youtube-digest` on macOS or Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\youtube-digest` on Windows. You may use a different folder.
4. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`.
5. Turn on **Developer mode**.
6. Click **Load unpacked**.
7. Select the exact project folder you chose, which must contain `manifest.json`.
8. Pin YouTube Digest from Chrome's Extensions menu if you want quick access.

Because this is an unpacked extension, it does not update automatically. After downloading an update or changing local files, click **Reload** on the YouTube Digest card at `chrome://extensions`, then refresh open YouTube tabs. Moving or deleting the source folder breaks the unpacked extension until you load it again from the new location.

## Set up your API keys

YouTube Digest needs two kinds of keys under your own service accounts:

1. A **Supadata API key** to retrieve YouTube transcripts.
2. An **AI Provider API key** for overviews, explanations, translation, and automatic note polishing.

### Get a Supadata API key

1. Open the official [Supadata sign-up page](https://dash.supadata.ai/auth/sign-up).
2. Create an account and complete the short onboarding flow.
3. Supadata generates an API key automatically during onboarding.
4. Open the [Supadata dashboard](https://dash.supadata.ai/) whenever you need to find or manage the key.
5. Copy the key and paste it into **Supadata API key** in YouTube Digest Settings.

See the [official Supadata documentation](https://docs.supadata.ai/) if the dashboard flow changes.

### Add an AI Provider

1. Open **Settings**, choose **Add Provider**, and select DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo, or a custom OpenAI-compatible service.
2. Create an API key in that Provider's official dashboard. For DeepSeek, use the official [API Keys page](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
3. Enter the key yourself in the new Provider card. Check the editable HTTPS API address and model against the Provider's current documentation.
4. Choose **Test connection**. Chrome asks for access only to that Provider's API origin.
5. Choose **Enable**, then save the settings. You can keep other cards and switch later.

Open **Settings** from the side panel. You can also open the YouTube Digest **Options** page from its card at `chrome://extensions` or by right-clicking its toolbar icon. Paste keys only into these Settings fields. Never paste a key into an AI chat, repository file, screenshot, or public message.

Provider cards store separate credentials, endpoints, and models. DeepSeek and Xiaomi MiMo use their own non-thinking request rules; Claude and Gemini use native protocol adapters; OpenAI, OpenRouter, MiniMax, and custom OpenAI-compatible services use the compatible chat adapter. Provider-specific rules remain isolated.

Keys and settings are stored in Chrome's local extension storage on your device. Release builds do not include or use `config.js`.

## Use YouTube Digest

1. Open a standard YouTube watch page with captions.
2. Click the YouTube Digest extension icon to open the side panel.
3. In **Transcript**, choose **Original**, **中文**, or **双语** for the timestamped transcript.
4. Open **Overview** for AI-generated chapters and key quotes, and choose that page's own **Original**, **中文**, or **双语** view.
5. Select transcript text when you want an AI explanation.
6. Save a note from the player or a key quote, then revisit it from **Notes** in that page's independent **Original**, **中文**, or **双语** view.

## What works today

- Google Chrome 116 or newer, using the Side Panel API.
- Standard `youtube.com/watch` video pages.
- Native subtitle tracks returned by Supadata. YouTube Digest prefers English when available, but may show another native language.
- Independent Original, Simplified Chinese, and aligned bilingual views for Transcript, Overview, and Notes.
- AI overviews, selected-text explanations, translation, and automatic note polishing.
- Local notes and a local cache for recent transcript and digest results.
- DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints for all published AI features.

Shorts, live streams, private or access-restricted videos, and videos without an available native transcript may not work. Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers, and other Chromium browsers are not currently tested or supported.

YouTube Digest forces Supadata's `mode=native`. It does not request AI-generated transcripts or perform local audio transcription when native captions are unavailable.

## Supadata free tier and request costs

Current as of August 9, 2026, the [Supadata pricing page](https://supadata.ai/pricing) lists a free tier with **100 credits per month**, no credit card required. Unused credits do not roll over. Supadata pricing can change, so check the current page before relying on these numbers.

The [Supadata transcript documentation](https://docs.supadata.ai/get-transcript) describes the transcript request modes and credit behavior:

- A native transcript request uses **1 credit**, regardless of video duration.
- A generated transcript costs **2 credits per video minute**. YouTube Digest does not use this path because it forces `mode=native`.
- An unavailable native lookup returned as HTTP `206` still uses **1 credit**.

With the current native-only behavior, the free tier can cover roughly 100 transcript lookups per month when each request succeeds once. Retries and unavailable-caption lookups also consume credits, so actual successful-video coverage can be lower.

AI Provider usage is separate from Supadata. YouTube Digest does not collect payments or resell access. Set spending limits and monitor every account you configure.

## DeepSeek V4 Flash pricing

As of August 27, 2026, DeepSeek lists these USD prices per 1 million tokens on its official [pricing page](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/):

| Token type | Off-peak | Peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Cache-hit input | $0.007 | $0.014 |
| Cache-miss input | $0.22 | $0.44 |
| Output | $0.66 | $1.32 |

Peak hours are 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC, Monday through Friday. All other hours use off-peak rates.

A measured 20-minute English talk used about **32,600 input tokens** and an estimated **3,500 to 4,500 output tokens** across 43 small translation batches. At current prices, translating the full video costs approximately:

- **Off-peak: $0.003 to $0.010 USD**.
- **Peak: $0.005 to $0.020 USD**.

The lower end assumes most repeated input hits DeepSeek's cache. The upper end assumes cache misses. Translation is lazy and cached, so translating only part of a video costs less. Check the official page before relying on these prices.

## Remix it with your coding agent

This is a personal remix project. Upstream issues and pull requests are not accepted. If something breaks or you want a new feature, download or fork your own copy and ask your coding agent to fix, remix, or personalize it for you.

YouTube Digest uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build step, so it is a friendly starting point for agent-assisted projects. Ideas to try:

- Add more translation languages and let each person choose a learning language.
- Create customized summary templates for lectures, interviews, tutorials, reviews, or research talks.
- Build a vocabulary notebook that saves a word, its sentence, meaning, and video timestamp.
- Export notes and vocabulary to Markdown, CSV, Anki, or another study tool.
- Add personal topic filters that highlight the chapters most relevant to a goal.
- Add optional local-model support for a different privacy and cost tradeoff.
- Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation, font controls, and higher-contrast themes.

Ask your agent to preserve the bring-your-own-key model, keep secrets out of source files, run the checks below, and test the remix on real videos.

If a service does not offer an OpenAI-compatible API and is not one of the native built-in adapters, open the exact project folder that Chrome loaded through **Load unpacked** in your coding agent and use **Copy customization prompt**. Never include an API key in the prompt or chat.

## Privacy and data flow

YouTube Digest makes provider requests directly from the extension:

1. It sends a canonical YouTube watch URL to Supadata to request the native transcript.
2. It sends the transcript and relevant video metadata to the AI Provider card you currently enabled when you request AI features.
3. Focused features send only the content they need, such as selected text with context or small transcript batches for translation.
4. It stores keys, settings, notes, and recent cache entries locally in Chrome.

There is no YouTube Digest account system, advertising, analytics, or telemetry. Supadata and your enabled AI Provider still receive data under their own terms and privacy policies. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### The Digest button is missing on a YouTube video

- At `chrome://extensions`, find YouTube Digest and click **Reload**, then refresh the YouTube tab.
- Confirm that you are on a standard `https://www.youtube.com/watch?...` page, not a Short, embed, or live page.
- The current version automatically follows YouTube when its responsive action bar changes. Wait a moment after the page finishes loading.
- If you have an older downloaded copy, resizing the YouTube window horizontally once may reveal the button. Then download the latest version so resizing is no longer required.
- If it is still missing, ask your coding agent to inspect the content script on that exact video page.

### The side panel does not open

- Confirm that you are on a standard `https://www.youtube.com/watch?...` page.
- At `chrome://extensions`, confirm YouTube Digest is enabled and click **Reload**.
- Refresh the YouTube tab after reloading the extension.
- Ask your coding agent to inspect the extension if the problem continues.

### YouTube Digest asks for setup

- Open **Settings**, save a Supadata key, and add at least one configured AI Provider card.
- Test the card's API address, key, and model, then make that card active.
- Existing v1.3 DeepSeek settings migrate automatically. A legacy unsupported custom key remains cleared because its original service cannot be identified safely.

### No transcript is found

- Confirm the video is public and has native captions.
- Check your Supadata key, remaining credits, rate limit, and account status.
- Remember that unavailable native lookups and manual retries may still consume credits.

YouTube Digest will not fall back to generated transcription.

### AI requests fail

- A `401` or `403` usually means the active Provider key or account access is invalid.
- A `429` usually means that Provider's rate or spending limit was reached.
- Reopen the active card in **Settings**, confirm its HTTPS endpoint and model, then run **Test connection**.

Never share API keys, private transcripts, or personal notes in chats, screenshots, or logs.

## Checks for coding agents

Ask your coding agent to run these commands after changing the project:

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run package
```

The agent should also reload the unpacked extension in Chrome and test several real YouTube videos. Automated checks do not prove that live provider requests and YouTube interactions work.
